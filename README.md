# EasyPoll

### Description
EasyPoll is an application that allows pollers to conduct polls easily and efficiently. When the program is launched, users are greeted with a GUI that allows them to choose whether they are creating a new poll or accessing an existing poll.  If they are creating a new poll, EasyPoll will allow the poller to enter all of the poll questions and answer choices.  Once they submit, the poll will be assigned a UUID and the poller will be asked to create an admin access code.  The poller can then distribute the UUID to anyone he/she wishes to partake in the poll.  When a user tries to access an existing poll, they will have the option to sign in as a pollee or a poller.  Pollees will need the poll's UUID, contrary to the poller who also needs the access code they created.  Pollees will be able to answer and submit the poll, while pollers will be able to edit the maximum number of responses or close the poll.  Once the poll has been closed or the maximum number of responses has been met, the poller can access the poll's results by accessing their existing closed poll.
